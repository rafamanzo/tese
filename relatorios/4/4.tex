\chapter{Previous meeting}
  \section{What was presented}
  Last time when we met, I've showed the results that I've achieved on a mask obtained from a fibre tracking with the stopping criteria at angles higher than 60 degrees instead of 45 degrees and then cropped to a small region of interest.

  The results using clustering algorithms showed no visually meaningful results for this small region. But, on the other hand, a implementation of a segmentation algorithm was capable of segmenting the corner region of the region of interest.

  \section{Next steps}
  From this we agreed that the next steps would be to first produce the maps the three eigenvalues of the tensor ($\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$), apply the same segmentation algorithm, then apply it to the FA, MD, RD and TV maps.

  After that, produce a prototype that accordingly to difference between the eigenvectors in order to produce a threshold mask. This should be configurable with parameters that may vary from full isotropy to full anisotropy.

\chapter{Work done}
  All the work expected from the last meeting was done in time as expected.

  \section{Eigenvalues differences threshold}
    Every index that we can extract from a tensor is associated to it's eigenvalues or is a combination of them. So looking at them, instead to derived indexes like FA, should provide more information about the dataset.

    Since the eigenvalues will be object of various discussions ahead we shall clarify that we are referencing the three eigenvalues as $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ in decreasing order.

    \subsection{Procedure}
    In more details, what we are looking for when trying to map uncertainty and certainty on a dataset, is the differences between those values. For example:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = 1.0$ and $\lambda_1 - \lambda_3 = 1.0$ and $\lambda_2 - \lambda_3 = 0.0$ represent what we call full anisotropy or, as we will reference to it later, perfect anisotropy;
      \item similarly, $\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = 0.0$ and $\lambda_1 - \lambda_3 = 0.0$ and $\lambda_2 - \lambda_3 = 0.0$ represent what we call full isotropy or, as we will reference to it later, perfect isotropy.
    \end{itemize}

    Those represent the two kinds of region we are pursuing to map: perfect anisotropy is the most certainty region; and perfect isotropy is the most uncertainty region.

    Given this concept, we must consider that both cases never happen in real datasets. So this brings us a relaxation by a parameter $0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1$ for the expressions previously mentioned:

    \newpage
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $1 - \epsilon \leq \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \leq 1.0$ and $1 - \epsilon \leq \lambda_1 - \lambda_3 \leq 1.0$ and $0.0 \leq \lambda_2 - \lambda_3 \leq \epsilon$;
      \item $0.0 \leq \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \leq \epsilon$ and $0.0 \leq \lambda_1 - \lambda_3 \leq \epsilon$ and $0.0 \leq \lambda_2 - \lambda_3 \leq \epsilon$.
    \end{itemize}

    Then, by increasing the $\epsilon$ step by step we may find a threshold for approximations of perfect anisotropy and isotropy.

    \subsection{Results}
      \subsubsection{Control experiments}
      The whole dataset considered for this experiments is:

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs/whole.png}
        \caption{Sagital cut at (70, 70, 48) for the whole mask.}
        \label{fig:whole}
      \end{figure}

      This region has the following statistics:

      \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
        \hline
        Number of voxels & FA mean & FA Standard Deviation \\ \hline
        460353 & 0.1964880 & 0.1662012 \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}

      .\newline

      For comparison purposes, lets first look at a simple FA threshold at 0.2 which should give us just the white matter:

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs/fa_02threshold.png}
        \caption{Sagital cut at (70, 70, 48) for a FA threshold of 0.2.}
        \label{fig:fa_threshold}
      \end{figure}

      This region has the following statistics:

      \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
        \hline
        Number of voxels & FA mean & FA Standard Deviation \\ \hline
        166316 & 0.3854053 & 0.1307380 \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}

      .\newline

      Finally, I first tried to run it with perfect anisotropy and isotropy parameters with no relaxation which produced empty masks for both cases as expected.

      \newpage

      \subsubsection{Relaxed perfect anisotropy and isotropy}
      Then following I've ran the eigenvalues threshold with relaxations first for the perfect anisotropy case producing the following chart:

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs/perfect_anisotropy_relaxed_chart.png}
        \caption{Evolution of the statistics accordingly to the relaxation increase.}
        \label{fig:perf-ani-chart}
      \end{figure}

      The first three steps gave really small regions. But for the fourth the region size increased significantly with some loss on the FA mean value:

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs/eg_10_10_00_0875.png}
        \caption{Sagital cut at (70, 70, 48) for a perfect anisotropy threshold relaxed to 0.875.}
        \label{fig:perf-ani-0875}
      \end{figure}

      Which looks like like a subset of the FA threshold (\ref{fig:fa_threshold}).

      Next I've repeated the experiment relaxing the threshold for the perfect isotropy case, producing the following statistics:

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs/perfect_isotropy_relaxed_chart.png}
        \caption{Evolution of the statistics accordingly to the relaxation increase.}
        \label{fig:perf-ani-chart}
      \end{figure}

      Which we can see the results for each step here:
